                <div class="ind">
                    <div class="p-desc-ind">I had an amazing opportunity this summer to intern at 
                        FORM, as a digital product designer. I met some amazing 
                        people there who helped me grow as a designer and I will 
                        always be grateful for this chance I got. 
                    </div>
                    <div class="p-desc-ind">My primary responsibilities were to work closely 
                        with other members of the Product team to brainstorm 
                        ideas to improve swim experience for users. Secondly, 
                        to craft UX deliverables such as annotated user flows 
                        and wireframes to effectively communicate design ideas. 
                        Lastly, to deliver high-fidelity UI designs for iOS, 
                        Android and FORM goggles.

                <div class="p-title-ind">My experience</div>
                <div class="ind">
                    <div class="p-desc-ind">I have learned everything I know about 
                        product design through this internship in terms of applying 
                        what I learned in school in a real company and working with 
                        legitimate users. <span class="bold">However, the two main things I learned were 
                            how to communicate clearly, confidently and effectively & to 
                            use a design system on Figma properly. </span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="p-desc-ind">As a designer, it was essential for me to learn 
                        the art of presenting designs well to the team and effectively 
                        conveying my idea. Unfortunately, it took some time for me to be 
                        organized and efficient in this matter. But now, I can 
                        present my designs confidently and say why a particular idea works 
                        to improve user experience. Secondly, I was exposed to a design 
                        system more extensive than I had ever used before. I learned how 
                        to use components, instances and variants, which helped me be more 
                        consistent and detail-oriented.
