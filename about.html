            <p class="main">Iâ€™m a third-year <a class="link" href="https://www.sfu.ca/siat.html">Interactive Arts and Technology</a> (SIAT) student at Simon Fraser University
                and I am highly passionate about design. Since childhood, I was highly observant 
                about everything around me and I believe that it is an essential quality to have 
                for a UX designer. Now a few years later, I joined SIAT, to learn more 
                about my passion about UX design.

                I am also very fond of about photography and I do take photos during my free time. I feel like the skill I use in photography 
                really helps me when I design as the concepts like color and proportion are similar.
                 
                Lastly, I love food. I try to explore different cuisines and one good meal will instantly 
                make my day and lift my mood.
