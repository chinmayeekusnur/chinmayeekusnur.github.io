            <p class="main">I'm Chinmayee Kusnur, a user experience designer and a third-year <a class="link" href="https://www.sfu.ca/siat.html">Interactive 
		    Arts and Technology</a> (SIAT) student. Since childhood, I have been highly observant about things around me and how they are portrayed, which is 
		    essential for a UX designer. I focus on getting the information communicated smoothly without any hindrance. I thrive on challenges and 
		    am passionate about designing products that make life easy. Therefore, I make minimalistic but functional design decisions and amalgamate 
		    grids, layouts, colour, and fonts while designing. My design process starts with brainstorming ideas via flowcharts on paper, making 
		    low-fidelity mockups on paper, and finally making high-fidelity mockups on Figma.

                I am also very fond of about photography and I do take photos during my free time. I feel like the skill I use in photography really helps me 
		    when I design as the concepts like color and proportion are similar. Lastly, I love food. I try to explore different cuisines and one good 
		    meal will instantly make my day and lift my mood.
