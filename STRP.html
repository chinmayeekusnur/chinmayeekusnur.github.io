        <h2 class="sub-heading">Prompt</h2>

        <p class="color-description desc">
          For a course I took, Information design, we were told to create graphic 
          assets and a microsite for RAW colour to showcase their work in the STRP 
          exhibition. At the beginning of this project, we were told to study Allen 
          Hori, an experimental designer, and take inspiration from him for this 
          project. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Allen Hori Graphical Experimentation</h2>

        <p class="color-description desc">
          Based on our research and detailed study of Allen Hori's design style, we 
          learnt more about experimenting with layers and color. Here are our initial 
          designs based on Allen Hori's style. 
        </p> 

        <div class="grid three-column">
          <img class="co-sc main-img desktop-version" src="img/ah11.png" alt="ah11" height="219" width="368">
          <img class="co-sc main-img desktop-version" src="img/ah33.png" alt="ah33" height="219" width="368">
          <img class="co-sc main-img desktop-version" src="img/ah22.png" alt="ah22" height="219" width="368">
        </div>

        <p class="main">
          The first image on the left talks about how humans are on top of the 
          food chain, and we are at the tip of the triangle, which is why we have 
          massive ego, and we feel we are superior to everyone around us. 
        </p>

        <p class="main">
          This is the graphic asset that Soraya and I worked on, and I was in 
          charge of designing the poster. Here posthumanism is about combining 
          humans with machines, and so the tiny dots with lines that make up the 
          eye are like the fibre optic things. The eye is meant to be like a black 
          hole for the future, with endless technological advancements. So another 
          way to look at it is an eye, which also plays into artificial intelligence. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="main">
          The image on the extreme right was inspired by the fluid curves the 
          designer uses in his work, and we tried to incorporate that by using 
          yarn and taking photos of it. In the third image, we have scanned a 
          piece of yarn and used that as a graphic element. We used pink and 
          blue colour to depict the essence of posthumanism. We did this by 
          intertwining the yarn so that the colour red represents humans and 
          blue represents artificial machinery.

        <p class="color-description desc">
          After presenting our 3 directions, we decided to go ahead with the third 
          idea of the fibres and here are 3 graphical assets we produced for the event: 
          poster, lanyard cards and tickets.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Unpacking microsite details- landing page</h2>
        <p class="color-description desc">
          Here is our landing page, where again we tried to emphasize the red and 
          blue fibres that intertwine to depict posthumanism, and we used blender 
          software and after-effects to implement it. We faced some challenges here 
          because it was our first time working with interactions, and we had no 
          clue how to execute a physical idea onto a microsite. However, with the 
          help of more research and learning new software, we executed the fibre 
          concept beautifully.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Navigation</h2>
        <p class="color-description desc">
          The following gif below shows the navigation of the microsite. We decided 
          to opt for a horizontal navigation bar to deliver the most necessary 
          information for a user. According to me, it gives a futuristic feel to the 
          microsite because not many designers explore the horizontal scroll option, 
          and because we were doing a project about posthumanism, it was essential to 
          add something that is not very common indicates something that is ahead of 
          current times. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">About and speakers section</h2>
        <p class="color-description desc">
          The about and speakers section of the microsite provides visitors with 
          important information such as the event's date & time, a summary of the 
          topics discussed during the event and information about the speakers. 
          However, the main interaction is when the user hovers over 'ABOUT' or 
          the speaker's name, then their details will pop up to indicate how the 
          users will explore the event in person. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Ticket purchase page</h2>
        <p class="color-description desc">
          On the ticket page, visitors can specify the quantity of tickets they 
          wish to purchase. They can then proceed to enter their billing information 
          alongside their payment information. Visitors are provided an order summary 
          where they can proceed to confirm their purchase. When pressed, the STRP 
          and (IM)POSSIBLE BODIES brand allows the visitor to return to the landing 
          page.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Reflection</h2>
        <p class="color-description">
          This was the first project that I have hand-coded by myself with my teammate. 
          It was a great experience to know the process of converting designs  
          to actual code. As it was our first time, there are a few errors with 
          responsiveness and overall spacing. In addition, the form and footer design could be better 
          because this was the first time for me to transfer designs from Figma to code; 
          I had less time to focus on the site's design elements. Now, in hindsight, I 
          would fix those nitty-gritty things to make the site much better.
        </p>

        <p class="main-1">
          Nevertheless, I am happy that the concept behind using colour and interactions 
          in a particular way made our project successful. Selecting a vaccine booking 
          system instead of a general e-commerce website made me stand out amongst everyone 
          else doing this course. I believe that this wasn't something I had many references 
          to go through before making the microsite. In the end, I am very proud of my 
          teammate Firm and I for designing and coding this microsite.
