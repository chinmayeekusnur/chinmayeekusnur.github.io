                <div class="ind">
                    <div class="p-desc-ind"> In this project, we worked with a real 
                      client, Cirendipity Candles, to understand their current user 
                      experience through user research, interviews, surveys and 
                      ethnography studies. Then, we developed a solution that showcases 
                      Cirendipity Candles’ sustainable brand and silicone candle products 
                      through various visual representations ranging from animations, and 
                      infographics.

              <div class="ind">
                  <div class="p-desc-ind">Our first step was to talk to the owners, Yoonji Choi 
                    and Laura Ko and knowing the history of Cirendipity and their business practices. 
                    After A bunch of interviews with two of them, we came up with three initial 
                    key takeaways as mentioned below. They are the foundation of what we researched and 
                    built further in the project. 
                  <img class="project-img-ind" src="img/initial-research-takeaways.png"></div>
                  
                  <div class="p-desc-ind">Once we spoke to the founders, we surveyed their existing and 
                    potential customer to understand their target market and consumer behaviours. It helped us
                    understand their candle purchasing habits.

              <div class="ind">
                  <div class="p-desc-ind">Based on our initial research of the company as well as 
                    it's target market, it was essential for us to know who we are designing for. 
                    We came up with three personas who matched our research well. 

                    Firstly, Angela, the Influencer represents being proactive in promoting sustainable practices through social media. 

                    Secondly, Catherine represents the deal seeker portion of our data as many of our participants only bought candles when they were on sale. 
                    
                    Lastly, Mark represents the sustainable lifestyle, being very mindful of how his actions affect the environment.

                  <div class="p-desc-ind">Personas gave a surface level of understanding of the
                    target audience, but it was essential to dig deeper, so we created two journey 
                    maps for Mark and Angela because they fit the target audience the best. </div>

                  <div class="p-desc-ind">Looking at the journey map, I brought two important 
                    insights to the team which was essential to understand. Firstly, Cirendipity
                    has very limited information about themsleves online and whatever they have 
                    is only limited to instagram, which is not enough for them. Secondly, they 
                    don't have any reviews on online about their candles, which makes it hard for 
                    people to trust their brand and purchase candles from them. 
                  </div>
                     
                  
              
              </div>
              
            </div>

            <div class="grid two-column-ind">

              <div class="p-title-ind">Revised Personas</div>
              <div class="ind">
                  <div class="p-desc-ind">After making the journey maps, I still felt like we could dig 
                    deeper to understand the ideal customer for Cirendipity. So, I revisited our meeting notes 
                    with the founders saw that an ideal customer for them is someone who is highly passionate 
                    about sustainability and appreciates high quality products made with organic materials. 
                    This key insight gave me the opportinuty to articulate Nicole, who was the driving force to 
                    formulate the design problem and focus.

                  <div class="p-desc-ind">Here is our design problem and focus that we 
                    formulated in order to prep for our participatory workoshop, which 
                    was the next step of our project.

              <div class="ind">
                  <div class="p-desc-ind">Before thinking of design solutions for the problem we outlined 
                    earlier, we wanted to conduct two design workshops, one with the two cofounders was to better 
                    understand their own perception of a sustainable brand. We wanted to focus more on 
                    sustainability as that is a big part of Cirendipity’s brand identity. The second one was 
                    with potential customers to see how they perceive Cirendipty’s sustainable brand ethos. Here are 
                    my main takeaways-</div>

                    <div class="p-desc-ind">
                      1. Cirendipity and Candle Lovers have different perspectives on sustainability, both in terms of colours and keywords used to define it
                    </div>

                    <div class="p-desc-ind">
                      2. Potential customers have not been informed about Cirendipity’s silicon candle cup which is their method of reducing single-use container waste and a key distinctive selling factor
                    </div>

                    <div class="p-desc-ind">
                      3. Both groups have similar ideas about how to improve candle shopping experience
                    </div>

                    <div class="p-desc-ind">
                      
                        By the end of the workshop, we tweaked our design focus to 
                        <span class="bold">"How might we represent Cirendipity’s sustainable brand to their 
                        potential customers and effectively communicate about their 
                        silicon refillable candle products?"
                        </span>  
                    </div>

            <div class="grid two-column-ind">

              <div class="p-title-ind">Potential Design Solutions</div>
              <div class="ind">
                  <div class="p-desc-ind">The first concept it revolves around 
                    having a consistent visual branding to represent Cirendipity's 
                    sustainable brand, specifically for their instagram. 
                    The solution is to have a consitant visual identity which will 
                    connect Cirendipity with their potential customers with how they 
                    both interpret sustainability through colours and images.
                    
                     
                    <img class="project-img-ind" src="img/concept1.png" alt="personas"> </div>
                    <div class="ind">
                      <div class="p-desc-ind">The second solution stems from the issue 
                        that Cirendipity's potential customers have not been informed 
                        about Cirendipity’s silicon candle cup which is their method of 
                        reducing single-use container waste and a key distinctive selling 
                        factor.
        
                        The main goal of this concept is to show an interactive tutorial 
                        that will be designed to demonstrate the step-by-step process of 
                        how to refill the candle wax using this silicone cup. 
                        
                        Reduce the information gap of the silicone candle cup and its 
                        usage. It will also help Cirendipity build a connection with 
                        their customers through an online interactive platform.</div>

                    For the final design solution, we created a webpage that 
                    showcases Cirendipity Candles’ sustainable brand and silicone candle products through various visual representations ranging from animations, and infographics. 
                  </div>
                  <div class="p-desc-ind">
                    Since Cirendipity currently does not have a website, having a website will help the business communicate their sustainable brand ethos professionally and increase their credibility. By using imagery to represent Cirendipity, users will be able to quickly identify what makes Cirendipity different from other candle brands as well as communicate how sustainability is achieved through their silicone candle products.

                    and how to speak to real clients. The project lasted four months and 
                    there were many times when our opinions clashed, but it was a learning 
                    experience to understand everyone's perspective, which helped build a 
                    good final solution. Overall, I am very grateful for this project as 
                    it helped me to think differently and work dynamically with a group of 
                    fellow designers.
